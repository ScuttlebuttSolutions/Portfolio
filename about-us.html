          <h2><strong>Who We Are</strong></h2>
          <p><strong>Scuttlebutt</strong> burst into life after a few cuppers around the water barrel on the stern of the mighty <strong><em>Old Barnacle</em></strong>. Realizing their greater potential was to come together and offer encompassing plundering solutions. Located near <strong>Doubloon Reef</strong> and <strong>Olde Booty Springs</strong> just an hour's row from <strong>Jumping Frog Reef</strong> feel free to make an appointment....if ye dare!</p>
        </aside>
